The IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis project focuses on classifying movie reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. 
The dataset used contains thousands of real movie reviews from IMDB, each labeled according to the sentiment expressed.

This project was designed to explore how machines can understand and interpret human language and emotion through text. 
By applying techniques like text preprocessing, tokenization, vectorization (TF-IDF/Bag-of-Words), and model training, the system was able to achieve high accuracy in determining the sentiment of unseen reviews.

Main Goal :

To build a sentiment classifier that helps in understanding customer opinion, which can be extended for product reviews, social media analysis, and brand sentiment monitoring.
